The following analysis and visualisation tools are provided.

Start by running the command `ecvs_in_reports.py` to compute and save the ECV count for each chapter. Several visualisation tools allow to present the data:
- ECVs count in all AR6 reports: `plot_ecvs_count.py`
- Top `n` ECVs count in each AR6 report: `plot_chapters_vs_ecvs.py` or `plot_ecvs_vs_chapters.py`
